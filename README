Welcome to Al-shell.
--------------------

PREFACE

This is a als-shell, console file manager for Unix. It currently running
on FreeBSD and Linux. In the nearest future I plan to port it on Solaris.
I coded this stuff for my own needs and used some ideas from Assistant Shell
(by Sergei Vovk). It's free for use and modify (only send me your diffs).
Feel free to contact me via e-mail or FidoNet, especially if you find bug
or have suggestions.


COMPILING AND INSTALLING

First of all you need curses and GNU readline libs installed. 
In most systems curses is installed by default. Last version of readline 
you can find at www.gnu.org. Other steps are quite simply:

- Unpack sources
- edit Makefile to suit you system and taste
- type make
- type make install


CONFIGURING

Main configuration file is $HOME/.alsrc. It consist of a number of lines,
one line for one statement. Lines beginning with # are ignored. Just change
statements for you needs. This file is self-explanatory. To make changes
has effect, restart als.


HOT KEYS

There are several keys not described in .alsrc. They are hard compiled.

Cursor keys     navigation in the directory listing.
Enter           execute program if file has exec rights or change to
                selected directory
Ctrl+L          refresh screen
Ctrl+H			show/hide hidden files (beginning with dot)
R               reread current directory
Backspace       cd to parent directory
Space           tag current file
+               tag files by mask
-               untag files by mask
0               quit als

In command line try to use cursor keys and Tab for autocompletion.
